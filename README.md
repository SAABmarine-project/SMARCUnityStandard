# SMARC Unity Standard

Welcome to the Standard (Built-in Engine) version of SMARC Unity.
This project has all of the dependencies configured and installed in order to showcase the [SMARC Unity Assets package](https://github.com/martkartasev/SMARCUnityAssets) with minimal effort.

## SAABmarine

This is the SMARC Unity Standard project with additional features for SAABmarine. The purpose of these features is to create a simulation for the BlueROV2 heavy configuration. If you wish to run the exact setup as during the hk-demo, set both this repo and the Assets repo (SMARCUnityAssets) to branch `hk-demo`. TODO: the missing prefab is the plane from the hk-demo, currently only localy saved on Alan computer.

## New to Unity?

------

If you have not used unity before I suggest trying out a few tutorials from https://learn.unity.com/

To get started, I suggest you familiarize yourself with the editor from: https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/explore-the-unity-editor-1#

### I cannot see anything!

If you want to jump in quickly to see the sim, follow the next few steps.

1. In the Project Window (tab at the bottom) open: Scenes/WaterSimulation.Unity
2. In the central panel, click on Scene. This is the "Editor" window. The "Game" window is simply a camera that has been set up into the scene.
3. In the Hierarchy (panel on the left side), double click on SAM to pan to it.
4. Click the Play button

From here you should be able to move SAM around using the arrow keys and WASD. You might want to drag and drop the Game window (you can split the view), so you can see both the Scene and Game windows in parallel.
